/**
 * We have a list of customers and we are fairly certain
 * that there are duplicates in the list.
 *
 * You must count the number of duplicates and possible duplicates.
 *
 * A duplicate is a customer where their first name, last name, and email address all match.
 * A possible duplicate is where their first name and last name match but they have different email addresses.
 *
 * The list of customers is found in the json document 'customers.json' found in the resources directory.
 * You must load and deserialize the document into a list of Customer objects. (The customer object is found in the models package)
 * Feel free to use any open source library you would like to aid you in the deserialization. (Hint: Gradle is your friend)
 * Once you have a list of customer objects count the number of duplicates and the number of possible duplicates.
 * Print your totals on the console.
 *
 * Other Notes:
 * A matching pair is considered 1 duplicate. Three of the same is considered two matches. (i.e. N - 1)
